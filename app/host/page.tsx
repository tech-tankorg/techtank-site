            Every month, TechTank hosts an in-person meetup or community event
            oriented around a technical talk as well as networking/mingling
            before and after. We rely upon sponsorship from companies in the
            Toronto area to provide a venue and food for that event.

              If you have any positions open, there is no more effective way to
              reach a wide audience for such a low cost. Even if you don’t have
              a lot of positions open at the moment, the goodwill created in the
              community pays dividends when someone runs across your job posting
              in the future.

            <p className={Styles.paragraph}>
              We know a lot of companies are struggling to find the right
              balance between remote and in-person work. What better way to
              encourage your people to come back to the office than hosting an
              awesome event that they themselves want to come to?

              The tech community is way more interrelated than we all think.
              Most companies rely upon open-source projects to function. Being a
              supporter of communities like TechTank that help the Toronto tech
              scene is just good karma. And good karma leads to good karma.
