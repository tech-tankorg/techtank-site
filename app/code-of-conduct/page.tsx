      <div>
        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>
          We, the admin team at TechTank, are happy to have grown to such a
          large group in such a short amount of time. As we value the
          participation and enjoyment of everyone in our community, we have
          decided to release community guidelines/codes of conduct. Our goal and
          wish is that everyone has a positive experience, and these codes apply
          to ALL community spaces: our slack workspace, in-person and virtual
          social gatherings, and direct messages. Repeated unacceptable
          behaviour will lead to expulsion from the group as we are here to
          create a safe and inclusive space for everyone.
        </p>
      </div>
      {/* ENFORCEMENT */}
      <div>
        <h4>Enforcement</h4>
        <p>
          Instances of abuse, harassment or any unacceptable behavior can be
          reported to Chris, Erik, Nonso, and Sammy. We will take corrective
          action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening,
          offensive or harmful. We have a right to protect this space and
          individuals within.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Notice of Correction → We will contact said individual to correct
            their behavior via slack
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Temporary Ban → banned from the community for weeks. This
            includes interaction in community spaces, external channels and
            direct messages on and off the community.
          </li>
          <li>3. Permanent Ban</li>
        </ul>

      {/* UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR */}
      <div>
        <h4>Unacceptable Behavior</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A. No hate speech or discriminatory language: Do not engage in or
            tolerate any form of hate speech, including but not limited to
            racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist language.
          </li>
          <li>
            B. No discrimination: Treat all individuals with fairness, respect,
            and dignity, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation,
            religion, nationality, disability, or any other characteristic.
          </li>
          <li>
            C. No harassment: Do not engage in any form of harassment, including
            verbal, written, physical, or visual harassment. This includes but
            is not limited to offensive jokes, derogatory comments, unwelcome
            advances, or persistent unwelcome communication. This includes
            asking for referrals from people you have not had contact with
            prior.
          </li>
          <li>
            D. No bullying or intimidation: Do not engage in any behavior
            intended to intimidate, belittle, or demean others within the group.
          </li>
          <li>
            E. *No feigning surprise: Don&apos;t act surprised or belittle
            others when they express not knowing something, whether it&apos;s a
            technical or non-technical topic.
          </li>
          <li>
            F. *No well-actually&apos;s: Avoid making minor corrections solely
            for the purpose of grandstanding, particularly if they don&apos;t
            significantly contribute to the conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            G. *No back-seat driving (in irl, face-to-face contexts): Refrain
            from intermittently offering unsolicited advice or interrupting
            ongoing conversations, as it can be disruptive and disrespectful.
            Instead, fully engage and participate when helping or joining
            discussions.
          </li>
          <li>H. Respect other people’s boundaries. No means no.</li>
          <li>
            G. Respect other people’s time. Many folx in the group, including
            the admins, have personal and professional lives outside of the
            group. Expect delays in responses especially on weekends and
            weeknights, and understand it might take time to respond to your
            query.{" "}

              others in the group, always consider posting in an appropriate
              channel before sending a DM to an admin.)

      {/* REFERRAL POLICY */}
      <div>
        <h4>Referral Policy</h4>
        <p>
          Recognizing the importance of referrals in professional networking,
          our administrative team has identified the need for explicit
          guidelines to foster beneficial interactions and maintain the
          integrity of our organization.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Referral Request Prudence: Members should refrain from requesting
            referrals during their initial interaction with an individual.
            It&apos;s essential to remember that successful referrals depend on
            a relationship of trust and mutual understanding, which requires
            more than a single interaction to establish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Respect for Professional Reputation: We must acknowledge that when
            someone provides a referral, they are staking their professional
            reputation on the line. Consequently, requesting a referral should
            not be a casual inquiry but a mindful consideration of the potential
            implications for the referring party.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By adhering to these guidelines, we can maintain a respectful,
          professional environment that fosters genuine networking and promotes
          sustainable growth for all members.
